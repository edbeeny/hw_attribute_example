# hw_attribute_example
## For concrete5 version 8+.

This is a really simple example. I have setup a few pages that enables you to create a custom event (not linking to the core calendar).
The fields are:

- Event Name
- Event Description
- Event Date From
- Event Date To
- Custom Attributes

I have setup a custom Attribute Category so you can add extra fields to the Event using Attributes

**This example shows how to**

- Include Doctrine Entities in Your Package 
- Show how to use ItemList and page pagination.
- Create single pages to show the itemlist
- create single page with a form to show how to update the database
- Creating a Custom Attribute Category against an Event

This is a working example of Advanced: Creating a Custom Attribute Category within the Concrete5 Documentation.
